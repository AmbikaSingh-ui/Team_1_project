1. Introduction
The Weather App is designed to deliver real-time weather information through an intuitive interface. Users can input a city name to receive current weather data, including temperature, conditions, and an appropriate weather icon. This project showcases the integration of web development skills with external APIs to create a dynamic and informative application.
Objectives
•	Provide functional weather retrieval based on user input.
•	Implement a clean, responsive design that enhances user experience.
•	Establish a foundation for future enhancements and features.

2. Technologies Used
The Weather App utilizes several technologies:
•	HTML: Structures the app’s layout, including input fields and display areas.
•	CSS: Styles the application for a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
•	JavaScript: Adds interactivity and manages API requests to retrieve weather data.
•	OpenWeatherMap API: Supplies real-time weather information from around the globe.
Additional Tools
•	Version Control: Git for managing code versions and collaboration.
•	Browser Developer Tools: For debugging and testing the application.

3. App Structure
HTML Overview
The HTML structure provides the foundational layout of the app, including:
•	A title for the application.
•	An input field for city names.
•	A button to initiate the weather retrieval process.
•	A section dedicated to displaying the weather information, which includes city name, temperature, and an icon representing the weather conditions.
CSS Overview
The CSS file defines the visual aesthetics of the app. Key elements include:
•	Responsive Design: Ensures the app looks good on various devices by using flexible layouts.
•	Visual Feedback: Enhances user interaction through styling of buttons and input fields.
JavaScript Overview
The JavaScript file handles the app's logic, including:
•	Event listeners for user interactions.
•	Functions to fetch weather data from the API and update the user interface based on the retrieved data.
•	Error handling to manage situations where user input is invalid or the API request fails.

4. Functionality Overview
Key Features
1.	City Input: Users enter a city name, triggering the retrieval of weather data.
2.	Real-Time Weather Data: The app fetches and displays weather information upon clicking a button.
3.	Dynamic UI Update: Weather details such as temperature and conditions are presented visually.
4.	Error Handling: Alerts users if an invalid city name is entered or if there are issues with the API.
User Interaction Flow
•	Users input a city name and click the button.
•	The app checks the input for validity and retrieves data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
•	The interface updates with relevant weather information or displays an error message.

5. API Integration
API Key Management
To use the OpenWeatherMap API, an API key is required:
1.	Account Creation: Users must register on the OpenWeatherMap website.
2.	API Key Generation: An API key is generated from the user dashboard.
Making API Requests
API requests are structured to obtain weather data based on the city name provided by the user. The application handles the response to extract necessary information such as city name, country, temperature, weather conditions, and icon.
Handling API Responses
The app parses the API response to display:
•	City Name
•	Country
•	Current Temperature
•	Weather Description
•	Weather Icon
